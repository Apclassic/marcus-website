				<h2>America’s Unanswered Problem</h2>
				<p>According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, 65% of fourth grade students and 66% of eighth grade students cannot read proficiently. Overall, progress in reading has not progressed in over a decade with the nation’s highest achievers stagnating and lowest performers falling further and further behind.</p>
				<p>Evidence-based intervention in the early grades demonstrate that students can become proficient readers, providing the necessary foundation for continued learning throughout middle, high school, and professional careers.</p>
				<p>However, if current trends continue, 83% of students who cannot read proficiently by 3rd grade are at increased risk of dropping out of high school, are twice as likely to be unemployed, are more likely to experience poor health outcomes, and have higher rates of involvement in the criminal justice system.</p>
